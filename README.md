# Advent of Code 2018

These are solutions originally written in 2018 for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) challenge. Whilst it is an improvement on my [2017 work](https://github.com/glsdown/adventofcode-2017), the solutions are messy and poorly structured (and there are very few comments).

A better structure for how to run this challenge can be found in my [2021 AOC repository](https://github.com/glsdown/adventofcode-2021). The solutions are still not polished in here, but the structure and helper functions are better designed.

Rather than go back and make these look neat and polished, I like to be able to reflect on where I started, and the improvements that I have made over the years.
